    Parameters
    ----------

    first_guess : array-like of shape (4*order)
        Initial guess for the coefficients of the Fourier Series.

    Method
    ------

    We use scipy.optimize.least_squares as a simple solver, given we have the equation:

    sum_{i=0}^{n} yearly_predictor + [(a{i}*x + b{i})*np.cos(\frac{np.pi*i*(mon)}{6}+(c{i}*x + d{i})*np.cos(\frac{np.pi*i*(mon)}{6})]
