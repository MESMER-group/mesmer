    Parameters
    ----------

        Yearly temperature values to predict with.

    monthly_target : array-like of shape (n_samples*12,)

    order : Integer
        Order of the Fourier Series.

    Method
    ------

    We use np.linalg.lstsq as a simple solver, given we have the equation:

    sum_{i=0}^{n} [(a{i}*x + b{i})*np.cos(\frac{np.pi*i*(mon%12+1)}{6}+(c{i}*x + d{i})*np.cos(\frac{np.pi*i*(mon%12+1)}{6})]

    we expect the input A to be of size n_samples, n*4-2 such that each column contains each coefficient's respective variable

    coeffs : array-like of shape (4*n-2)
