    """execute fitting of the harmonic model/fourier series

    Parameters
    ----------

    yearly_predictor : array-like of shape (n_years*12,)
        Repeated yearly temperature values to predict with.

    monthly_target : array-like of shape (n_years*12,)
        Target monthly temperature values.

    order : Integer
        Order of the Fourier Series.

    Method
    ------

    We use scipy.optimize.least_squares as a simple solver, given we have the equation:

    sum_{i=0}^{n} yearly_predictor + [(a{i}*x + b{i})*np.cos(\frac{np.pi*i*(mon)}{6}+(c{i}*x + d{i})*np.cos(\frac{np.pi*i*(mon)}{6})]

    We expect the yearly_predictor and monthly target to both be of size n_years*12, such that the yearly predictor contains each yearly value repeated 12 times to represent each month.

    -------
    coeffs : array-like of shape (4*order)
